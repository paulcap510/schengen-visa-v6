# Schengen Visa Calculator and Visa API

## Overview 

This is a visa calculator that allows users to calculate the number of days they have stayed in the Schengen Area within the last 180 days. This app offers a more efficient UI compared to official
sites. Specifically, it uses JavaScript to ensure users cannot enter dates past 180 days. It also allows users to enter dates for future trips.
